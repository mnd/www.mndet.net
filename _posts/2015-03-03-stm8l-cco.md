title: STM8L-DISCOVERY open drain on CCO pin
---
I write simple code that blinks with diodes on PE7 and PC7 GPIO pins. 
All works fine, but if I in same time set PC4 (CCO pin) to output open drain mode
then even blink example works incorrect.

Video demonstration:

In video I also disabled CCO output with CLK_CCOR register.
